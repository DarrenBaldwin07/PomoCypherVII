# Pomo.
*Built to track and improve your productivity through insightful data analytics.*

## What Makes Pomo Different?
Pomo takes the heavy lifting out of productivity. With a simple and clean user experience that helps keep distractions at bay, Pomo also allows you to visualize your time usage over a given period. Not only that, but you can also see insightful stats on things like how often you take breaks, or how many pomodoro sessions you complete. Pomo is an essential tool for those looking to improve their work efficiency and productivity.

## The Development of Pomo
Pomo is designed and maintained by Darren Baldwin Jr. and Luke Fisher. One of the challenges in this design came from the desire to create a simple and aesthetically pleasing UI, but not one that was too cluttered and distracting. Our team feels that the chosen design language is lightweight, fluid, and modern. With these ideas in mind, the chosen development stack consists of React JS and supabase. Both of these modern technologies will be easy to maintain and iterate as more updates roll out. Below are some photos of the UI and design aesthetic.

## Future Development
Our team is looking to deploy this web application via Vercel soon! In addition to being publicly hosted, we would like to implement a few other features, they're listed below.

1. Expanded user authentication for better privacy
2. Add more analytical data for users to view and save
3. Refactor the UI to be completely responsive
4. Create and host an official backend to securely handle data and relieve load from the frontend.

###### Final Note
Though this project was created during a 2 day hackathon, our team would like to continually update and improve our work. Feel free to reach out to any of the contributors with feedback!
